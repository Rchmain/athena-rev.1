    <h2>Why Athena?</h2>
    <p>Athena is built for Professional Services businesses that are tired of bloated administration and poor visibility into financial performance. With Athena, you can automate routine processes, empower your team with data, and focus on what matters—delivering exceptional service and growing your business.</p>
    <p>At its core, Athena captures staff time and attendance through easy-to-use timesheets and leave forecasting tools. This data is automatically transformed into client-ready timesheets, saving your administrators hours each week and ensuring accurate, timely approvals.</p>
    <p>By feeding this time and leave data into its engine, Athena continuously tracks actuals and monitors progress against budget across all your projects. This unlocks real-time P&L forecasting and delivers Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) insights to help you make better, faster business decisions.</p>
